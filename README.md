# Workflows!

Hello, dear programmer. Welcome to my workflow repository.

The purpose.
This code repository focuses on complete python fundamentals, and slowly scaling up to projects for the same in my journey.
As the future of my project work is subject to be added in separate repos for each, I shall not comment on the availability of that data on this one, however, I'll make sure to link them out as soon as I start that phase of my journey.
There will be regular code commits of my learnings throughout my Python journey here.
From Basic functional programming to OOPS, and eventually Core DSA Concepts, this repo will cover it all.

The Goal.
I want to believe that this will eventually be a resource intended for not just my revision purposes,
But also a great public library for clean, explained code, with commented lines wherever necessary for a fresh beginner to make his/her understanding easier, and why I did what I did in my code.
Granted, my approach may not be the best approach. In fact, I would urge the programmer to try and complete every snippet themselves, before looking at my approach, since that is where real learning would actually happen.

I hope you enjoy reading this data as much as I enjoyed embarking on this endeavour.
Godspeed.






I like to code python everyday.
