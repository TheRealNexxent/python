# This is a tutorial for Markdown.

This is smaller inside a heading.

## This is another Heading, but with 2 hashes!

Again data inside the heading.
Here if I press enter it wont be a new line or para, you need to put two enters to make it work! [Once Enter Pressed.]

Like this. [Twice Enter Pressed]

Also, if you want it to be in same para but new line, then put two spaces like i just did right now:  
boom!

And  break here  
boom!

Text is   


**bold**  
*Italic*  
___Italic___
__Another Bold__  
a__bol__d wont work.  
__*Bold Italic*__  
~~crossoff~~  
<mark>Highlight</mark>  
is nothing but ==highlight==  
A<sup>2</sup>  
A<sub>2</sub>  

ðŸ˜Š  


`print("Hello World)`  

```python
print("Hello World)
while true:
    print("True")
```
